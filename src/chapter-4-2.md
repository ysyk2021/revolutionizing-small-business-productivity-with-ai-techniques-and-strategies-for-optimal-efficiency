Machine learning algorithms can also be used to optimize inventory management for small businesses. By analyzing data on sales trends and customer demand, AI-powered tools can provide personalized recommendations for inventory levels and reorder points, reducing waste and ensuring that products are always in stock.

Marketing Strategies
